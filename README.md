# labs-DD2390

This is a repository for my lab assignments during the spring of 2016 in the course DD2390 (Internet Programming) at KTH.

## How to run the chat server
1. Open three terminal windows
2. Go to `labs-DD2390/Chat-server/bin`
3. In the first terminal window, type `java ChatServer`

5. Done! Whenever you type messages from one of the users, the others will see it together with the sender's username
